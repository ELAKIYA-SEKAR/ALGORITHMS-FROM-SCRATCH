# ALGORITHMS-FROM-SCRATCH
Machine Learning can be difficult to understand. An approach that you can use to get handle on ML algorithms and practices is to implement them from scratch.This will give you a deep understanding of how the algorithm works and all of the micro decision points within the method that can be parameterized or modified to tune it to a specific problem.
